# Java Learning Journey
This repository contains my Java practice and notes as I learn Java step by step.

## Goals
- Understand Java fundamentals
- Practice object-oriented programming
- Build a strong programming foundation in Java for Software Development.
  My Java learning from basics to OOP
## Topics covered so far
- Variables and data types
- User input using Scanner
- Java Input Handling (7/02/26)
  I learned about an issue when using 'Scanner' to accept 'int' or 'double' input before a 'String'.
     **Problem**
  When switching from numeric input to 'nextLine', the input buffer keeps the newline character, causing the string input to be skipped.
     **Solution**
  Consume the leftover newline using an extra 'scanner.nextLine()'.
  This helped me understand how Java handles input internally.
  -Rectangle Area Calculator(9/02/26)
  I created a simple Java program that calculates the area of a rectangle using user input.
  -**Concepts practiced**
  Using 'Scanner' for user input
  Working with 'double' values
  Basic arithmetic operations
  Output formating
  -**Formula**
  Area= lenth*width
  -Mad Libs Game(11/02/26)
  A simple interactive console game. The program asks the user for different words and generates a funny story using the provided input.
  **-Concepts practiced**
  -Scanner
  -String concatenation
  -Console output formatting
  Arithmetic Operations Practice(12/02/2026)
  A Java program demonstrating basic arithmetic operators;
  - Addition(+)
  - Subtraction(-)
  - Multiplication(*)
  - Division(%)
  - Modulus(%)
    **Concepts practiced**
    - Integer and double calculations
    - Order of operations
    - Console output
  ## Augmented Assignment Operators(12/2/2026)
  A Java program demonstrating the use of:
  - += (addition assignment)
  - -= ( subtraction assignment)
  - *= ( multiplication assignment)
  - /= ( division assignment)
  - %= ( modulus assignment)
  ## Concepts practiced:
  - Updating variable values
  - Short-hand arithmetic operations
  - Understanding operator behavior 
## Learning approach
- Practice-based learning
- Small examples for each concept
- Consistent progress updates on GitHub
