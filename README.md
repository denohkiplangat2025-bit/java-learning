# Java Learning Journey
This repository contains my Java practice and notes as I learn Java step by step.

## Goals
- Understand Java fundamentals
- Practice object-oriented programming
- Build a strong programming foundation in Java for Software Development.
  My Java learning from basics to OOP
## Topics covered so far
- Variables and data types
- User input using Scanner
- Java Input Handling (7/02/26)
  I learned about an issue when using 'Scanner' to accept 'int' or 'double' input before a 'String'.
     **Problem**
  When switching from numeric input to 'nextLine', the input buffer keeps the newline character, causing the string input to be skipped.
     **Solution**
  Consume the leftover newline using an extra 'scanner.nextLine()'.
  This helped me understand how Java handles input internally.
  -Rectangle Area Calculator(9/02/26)
  I created a simple Java program that calculates the area of a rectangle using user input.
  -**Concepts practiced**
  Using 'Scanner' for user input
  Working with 'double' values
  Basic arithmetic operations
  Output formating
  -**Formula**
  Area= lenth*width
  
## Learning approach
- Practice-based learning
- Small examples for each concept
- Consistent progress updates on GitHub
